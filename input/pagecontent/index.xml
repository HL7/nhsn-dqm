  <p>
    This content describes the specifications for the for the Health Level Seven International® (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability 
    Resources® (FHIR) digital quality measures (dQMs) reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The specifications are 
    based on HL7 FHIR Release 4 (R4)<sup><a href="#fhir_r4">1</a></sup>, US Core 3.1.1 profiles<sup><a href="#us_core">2</a></sup>, 
    QI Core 4.1.1 profiles<sup><a href="#qi_core">3</a></sup>, Quality Measure IG 3.0.0 profiles<sup><a href="#cqf_measures">4</a></sup>,

  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    These specifications define the data content requirements for submissions to NHSN through NHSNLink.

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    These specifications are for the content contained within the encounters identified as meeting 
    the criteria for the dQM Initial Population. The dQM IP defines the cohort population from 
    which NHSN analysts determine the denominator and calculate events per the metrics defined 
    in each NHSN protocol. The Initial Population can vary between dQMs and may include all 
    inpatient, emergency department, and observation encounters. NHSNLink (or other compiling 
    system) gathers the line-level data for calculating the NHSN metrics along with data needed 
    for stratification, risk adjustment, or benchmarking once the encounter meets the criteria for 
    the Initial Population.

  <h3>Scope</h3>
  <p>
    This document represents the content for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specifications for the initial population (IP) measure that informs 
    CDC's NHSN Glycemic Control, Hypoglycemia module (1). This page is under construction and is in draft format.</p>
  <a name="purpose"></a>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    The specification described here is for the initial population (IP) DQM. The IP dQM provides the necessary Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) line-level 
    data necessary for calculating CDC's NHSN Glycemic Control, Hypoglycemia module metrics (1). The IP measure is defined as all inpatient encounters, as well as emergency 
    department (ED) and Observation (OBS) encounters that end within 1 hour of the start of the inpatient encounter, for patients of all ages where at least one antidiabetic 
    drug (ADD) was ordered or administered during the encounter that is during the performance period. 
  </p>
  <a name="background"></a>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    The NHSN Glycemic Control, Hypoglycemia module provides a mechanism for facilities to report inpatient medication-related hypoglycemia events, and to provide analytic 
    reports based on these data to inform glycemic control quality improvement efforts and patient safety events. The primary objective of the NHSN Glycemic Control, 
    Hypoglycemia module is to facilitate measurement and benchmarking of medication-related hypoglycemia events within a facility. As additional data are collected by NHSN, 
    an additional objective will be to facilitate inter-facility benchmarking and evaluate national-level trends of medication-related hypoglycemia over time. The IP dQM 
    provides the FHIR line-level data necessary for calculating the module metrics.   
  </p>
  <a name="settings_and_patient_locations"></a>
  <h3>Settings and Patient Locations</h3>
  <p>
    The IP dQM provides the FHIR line-level data necessary for the NHSN Glycemic Control, Hypoglycemia module. This is for all patients ordered or administered ADDs from 
    all inpatient locations for inpatient facilities enrolled in NHSN and using the Medication Safety Component, except for long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and outpatient 
    dialysis facilities. ED and OBS encounters are also collected if they end within an hour of the inpatient admission (hospitalization). All participating facilities must 
    have the ability to report data electronically to NHSN using the required HL7 FHIR specifications (2).
