# US Core Variance received: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46467

US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# This IG does not include Bundle slices for the clinical data returned in MeasureReport.evaluatedResources, because that could potentially contain any type of resource.

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-dqm/StructureDefinition/nhsn-measurereport-bundle|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Currently DEQM requires measure score for subject list measure reports, which was an error. This causes and error in the MeasureReport and another in the Bundle that contains it since the MR does not match the slice unless error free. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46239?filter=-2

No measureScore when the scoring of the message is 'cohort'

# Currently DEQM requires measure score for subject list measure reports, which was an error. This causes and error in the MeasureReport and another in the Bundle that contains it since the MR does not match the slice unless error free. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46239?filter=-2

Slice 'Bundle.entry:subject-list': a matching slice is required, but not found (from http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-dqm/StructureDefinition/nhsn-measurereport-bundle|1.0.0). Note that other slices are allowed in addition to this required slice

# The Healthcare Capacity code system will be removed once LOINC codes have been assigned. The request is in process and is being managed by NHSN

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# INFORMATION: OID Based Code System that is externally managed

The definition for the Code System with URI 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' doesn't provide any codes so the code cannot be validated

# CodeSystems that are draft in THO, will need to be changed in future versions of THO
