# Error caused by an invalid rule in the IG Publisher. Issue logged here: https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/issues/1378

# Currently DEQM requires measure score for subject list measure reports, which was an error. This causes and error in the MeasureReport and another in the Bundle that contains it since the MR does not match the slice unless error free. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46239?filter=-2

No measureScore when the scoring of the message is 'cohort'


# The Healthcare Capacity code system will be removed once LOINC codes have been assigned. The request is in process and is being managed by NHSN

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# Will have to raise with NHSN if assigning OIDs to a Library is useful for this community

This resource could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

# INFORMATION: OID Based Code System that is externally managed

The definition for the Code System with URI 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' doesn't provide any codes so the code cannot be validated


# Acknowledged

The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# CodeSystems that are draft in THO, will need to be changed in future versions of THO
