No measureScore when the scoring of the message is 'cohort'

# Currently DEQM requires measure score for subject list measure reports, which was an error. This causes an error in the MeasureReport and another in the Bundle that contains. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46239

INFORMATION: Bundle/submission-full-example1: Bundle.entry[3].resource.group[0].measureScore.extension[0]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/StructureDefinition/subjectlist-measurereport-deqm|4.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# The Healthcare Capacity code system will be removed once LOINC codes have been assigned. The request is in process and is being managed by NHSN

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# OID Based Code System that is externally managed (PHIN-VADS CDC Race/Ethnicity code system)

The definition for the Code System with URI 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' doesn't provide any codes so the code cannot be validated

# We expect to replace the healthcare-capacity-codes CodeSystem with LOINC codes before publication (request in progress)

# CodeSystems that are draft in THO, will need to be changed in future versions of THO
