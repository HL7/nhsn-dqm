# Error caused by an invalid rule in the IG Publisher. Issue logged here: https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/issues/1378


# INFORMATION: OID Based Code System that is externally managed
The definition for the Code System with URI 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' doesn't provide any codes so the code cannot be validated

# NHSN dQMs do not  use performer in Observations. They are not included in samples in this IG
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# CodeSystems that are draft in THO, will need to be changed in future versions of THO
