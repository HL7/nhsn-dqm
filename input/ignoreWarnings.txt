# We are dependent on DEQM, so are using the same US Core version as that IG

The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 7.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# US Core Variance received: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46467

US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# Warnings generated by the US Core Organization snapshot

The slice 'CLIA' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The slice 'NAIC' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true

# These Bundle entries are not intended to match slices in the profile, as they are simply storing resources referenced from the MeasureReport resources in the defined slices. This IG does not define Bundle slices for the clinical data returned in MeasureReport.evaluatedResources, because that could potentially contain any type of resource.

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-dqm/StructureDefinition/nhsn-measurereport-bundle|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Intentionally added extensions not present in crmi-sharablemeasure slices

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/StructureDefinition/crmi-shareablemeasure|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/nhsn-submitting-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[10].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# The Healthcare Capacity code system will be removed once LOINC codes have been assigned. The request is in process and is being managed by NHSN

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# OID Based Code System that is externally managed (PHIN-VADS CDC Race/Ethnicity code system)

The definition for the Code System with URI 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' doesn't provide any codes so the code cannot be validated


# CodeSystems that are draft in THO, will need to be changed in future versions of THO

# Warnings or info messages inherited from dependencies in the snapshot

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
