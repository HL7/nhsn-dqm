# The measureScoring extension is set to cohort, not proportion. Same is true of the measure itself. This invariant is defined in DEQM, and the current build shows the same error in that IG. This seems to be an error in the FHIRPath of the invariant or the latest version of the IG Publisher itself.

Constraint failed: deqm-6: 'If the measure scoring type is 'proportion' then the measureScore SHALL be a numerical value between 0 and 1'

# US Core Variance received: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46467

US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# Warnings generated by the US Core Organization snapshot

The slice 'CLIA' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
The slice 'NAIC' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true

# These Bundle entries are not intended to match slices in the profile, as they are simply storing resources referenced from the MeasureReport resources in the defined slices. This IG does not define Bundle slices for the clinical data returned in MeasureReport.evaluatedResources, because that could potentially contain any type of resource.

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-dqm/StructureDefinition/nhsn-measurereport-bundle|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Intentionally added extensions not present in crmi-sharablemeasure slices

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/StructureDefinition/crmi-shareablemeasure|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Will be sticking with US Core 6.1.0 and QI-Core 6.0.0 since that is what the version of DEQM we are dependent on is using

The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# Warnings or info messages inherited from dependencies in the snapshot

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
